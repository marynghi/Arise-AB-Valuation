# Monte Carlo Simulation: Arise AB Stock Price

## Project Overview

This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation to model and forecast the future stock price of **Arise AB**, a renewable energy company. The analysis was conducted by me in contribution to the Natural Resources Sector at **SSIF (Student-Managed Sustainable Investment Fund)** to evaluate the stock's potential price behavior under uncertainty.

## Objective

To simulate the potential future price movements of Arise AB stock based on historical data, enabling a better understanding of its risk and return profile and supporting investment decision-making.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Historical stock price data for Arise AB was obtained from a Yahoo Finance.
2. **Log Returns**:
   - Calculated daily log returns to model the price changes.
3. **Monte Carlo Simulation**:
   - Generated multiple simulations of future price movements using:
     - Drift: Derived from the average historical return.
     - Volatility: Estimated from the standard deviation of historical returns.
   - Modeled stock prices using the equation:

     where \(Z\) represents random values from a standard normal distribution.
4. **Scenario Analysis**:
   - Ran thousands of iterations to create a range of potential outcomes.
   - Visualized results to identify potential price distributions and risks.

## Key Results

###Best & Worst Cases
1. Worst Case: SEK 8.85 per share
2. Average Case: SEK 40.01 per share
3. Best Case: SEK 148.06 per share
###Confidence Intervals
1 Sigma (1 S.D.): 68% confidence that the price after 250 days will fall between SEK 24.13 and SEK 55.88.
2 Sigma (2 S.D.): 95% confidence that the price after 250 days will fall between SEK 8.26 and SEK 71.76.
###Latest Price and Probabilities
Latest Price (Sâ‚€): SEK 37.10 per share
Probability of Price > Latest Price at Day 250: 50.35%
These results provide a robust framework for assessing potential future price movements, highlighting key risks and opportunities.

## Tools & Libraries

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
